# What is this?
`font_renamer` is a work-in-progress command-line tool for manipulating name
records in OpenType fonts: changing font family, subfamily and other name
records, manipulating locale-specific variants of name records etc.

# Why?
So I could:
- Fix name records in a large pile of font files, preferably in batches and
  automatically.
- Dip my toes into the OpenType spec.
- Play around with cool tools, technologies and concepts I've been interested
  in.

# To Do
- [ ] Platform-agnostic interaction.
- [ ] Command-line interface using Typer.
- [ ] Font name inference from existing records.
- [ ] Font name inference from filenames.
